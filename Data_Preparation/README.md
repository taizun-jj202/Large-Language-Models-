This Jupyter notebook, `Data_Preparation.ipynb`, demonstrates the crucial first step in building Large Language Models (LLMs): data preparation, specifically **tokenization**. <b>

When training an LLM, the raw input data is typically vast amounts of text. Since machines only understand numbers, this text data must be converted into a numerical format. This is where tokenization comes in.

## What is Tokenization?

Tokenization is the process of breaking down raw text into smaller units called "tokens". For simplicity in this demonstration, we consider each word as a single token. For example, the phrase "Hello, world!" might be tokenized into "Hello", ",", " ", "world", "!". This notebook processes a small text file of approximately 20,000 characters and tokenizes it into over 9,000 tokens.

## From Tokens to Token IDs

Once tokens are generated, each unique token is assigned a unique numerical identifier called a "token ID". This creates a vocabulary mapping strings to integers.

## Handling Unseen Words and Text Boundaries

A robust tokenizer needs to handle words it hasn't encountered during its initial vocabulary creation. For this, we introduce special tokens:

- `<|unk|>` **(Unknown Token**): This token ID is assigned to words that are not present in the tokenizer's vocabulary. This prevents errors and allows the model to process new or misspelled words.
- `<|endoftext|>` **(End-of-Text Token)**: This token is used to indicate the end of a piece of text or to concatenate multiple texts together, providing a clear boundary for the model.

## What's Next? 

While this notebook focuses on tokenization and assigning token IDs, a complete LLM pipeline would then convert these token IDs into vector embeddings. These embeddings represent words as numerical vectors in a multi-dimensional space, allowing the model to understand semantic relationships between words.
